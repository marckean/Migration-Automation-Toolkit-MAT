For more information be sure to download the MAT Installation and Usage Guide.

Q: How many VMs should I convert in a batch?
A: Test your performance to see but generally limit your batches to 20-30 VMs. Since you will want to test the converted machines and deal with the source for each. 
You should also limit your initial testing to one ESX host. 

Q: What versions of vCenter and ESX is MAT compatible with?
A: MAT is able to pull data from vCenter/ESX 3.5 Update 2 - 5.1  since it uses PowerCLI 5.1. 
However the MVMC engine is still limited to vCenter Server or ESXi Server 5.0 and vCenter Server or ESXi/ESX Server 4.1. There are pre-flight checks in the MAT to verify you are using the correct version.

Q: Does the MAT re-create my network cards on the resulting Hyper-V guest?
A: Yes, up to three nics and their settings can be converted. See the installation guide section on MigrateNICs.

Q: What are the disk space requirements?  
A: The MVMC engine will export the VM to a local temp folder on the machine responsible for conversion and then it will copy it to the Hyper-V share. 
If you plan to run multiple VM conversions at once, plan to accommodate for the temp copies as well as the final destination.

Q: Do I have to install MAT in C:\MAT?
A: No, the MAT can be moved to any folder path that DOES NOT contain spaces as long as you update the PowerShell script variables appropriately. 
You CANNOT move MAT to a mapped drives since PowerShell does not respect mapped drives. You can use full UNC paths. 
The location of the MAT files does not have any impact on the output created by MVMC in the user's %temp% path.

Q: What kind of firewall exceptions are needed for the main server to talk to the remote servers?
A: Open access to and from your SQL server and on any MAT servers open access to/from VMware environment and your Hyper-V host.

Q: Is there any limit to how many 'Helper' servers I can use?
A: In theory, no, you can add as many helpers as you wish. Take care not to point all the helpers to the same Hyper-V host however. You will saturate the host's network and disk IO. 
If you have the capacity point each helper to its own Hyper-V host for the best performance. 

Q: Does it matter which version of SQL I use?
A: No. You can use SQL Express 2012 or any version of SQL Server. 32 or 64-bit versions will work

Q: Occasionally MAT produces false positive messages in status, even though the conversion job terminated incorrectly. Why is this?
A: We rely on the exit code produced by each instance of MVMC.exe to determine the final state of the conversion. Always check you VM conversion log to verify the results. 
In future versions we will add logic to throw a mixed message if the final status collected from the log does not match the final exit code from the executable.

Q: I have MAT questions or suggestions for improvement, where can I send them?
A: MAT specific questions can be mailed to:  mat-questions@microsoft.com. 
If you are reporting a problem please set the value "$VerboseLogging = 7" and collect new logs. This will produce the most detailed logs possible.

If you need technical support, the MVMC is a supported product. The command line (minus passwords) for the MVMC.exe is logged for each conversion. 
You can take this command line and issue it outside of the MAT to verify the problem is reproducible with MVMC alone. If so contact support.
